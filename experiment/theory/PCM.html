            Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Starting in the 1920s, long-distance telephone links used frequency
            division multiplexing. A cable with a bandwidth of 3 MHz can support
            (in principle) 1000 3 kHz voice channels. But 1000 filters,
            modulators, and demodulators are needed.
            <br />
            Using PCM, multiple connections could be time division multiplexed
            (TDM). The Bell System settled on 1.544 Mbit/s (by experimentation).
            <br />
            8000 ‚Ä¢ (24 ‚Ä¢ 8 + 1) = 8000 ‚Ä¢ 193 = 1544000
            <br />
            Where the number of frames per second is 8000 and 24 8bit channels
            plus 1 framing bit.
            <br />
            This TDM signal is called digital signal level 1 (DS1). <br />
            This 24 to 1 digital multiplexing technique was used for the T1
            carrier system for voice communication.

            Instead of a pulse train, PCM produces a series of numbers or
            digits, and hence this process is called as digital. Each one of
            these digits, though in binary code, represent the approximate
            amplitude of the signal sample at that instant.

          <p class="pl-8">
            ‚Ä¢ The bit rate of a PCM signal can be calculated form the number of

            required to transmit this signal depends on the type of line

            <br />
            <br />
            ‚Ä¢ A digitized signal will always need more bandwidth than the
            original analog signal. Price we pay for robustness and other

            Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a multiplexing technique used to
            digitally represent sampled analog signals. Linear pulse-code
            modulation (LPCM) is a specific type of PCM in which the
            quantization levels are linearly uniform.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-[24px] font-semibold text-black">
            Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The encoder performs the function of differentiation; a quantizer
            precedes the differencing of adjacent quantized samples; the decoder
            is an accumulator, which if correctly initialized exactly recovers
            the quantized signal. <br />
            <br />
            DPCM takes the values of two consecutive samples; if they are analog
            samples, quantize them; calculate the difference between the first
            one and the next; the output is the difference.<br />
            <br />
            For example, m[k] is the sampled unquantized signal we want to
            transmit, and mq[k] is the quantized signal. m^[k] is the prediction
            of m[k] based on previous samples mq[k]. d[k] = m[k] ‚àí mÀÜ [k], the
            unquantized difference between m[k] and the prediction. dq[k] is the
            actual quantized difference that will be transmitted. A predictor
            will take previous samples of the signal, and compute the next
            expected sample.<br />
            <br />
            At the receiver side, the input is quantized difference signal
            dq[k]. The receiver will produce previous values of mq[k]. Then the
            predictor computes mq^[k], the next predicted sample. Then dq[k] is
            added to the predicted signal mq^[k] to recover the transmitted
            signal.

            Pulse Code Modulation
          </h3>
          <p>
            The transmitter section of a Pulse Code Modulator circuit consists
            of Sampling, Quantizing and Encoding, which are performed in the
            analog-to-digital converter section. The low pass filter prior to
            sampling prevents aliasing of the message signal. The construction
            filter helps to obtain the original signal. The signal strength can
            be enhanced through this regenerative repeater. So, the channel‚Äôs
            output also includes a regenerative repeater circuit to balance the
            signal loss, renovate the signal & also increases the signal
            strength.

            Pulse Code Demodulation
          </h3>
          <p>
            Pulse Code Demodulation will be doing the same modulation process in
            reverse. Demodulation starts with the decoding process, during
            transmission the PCM signal will be affected by noise interference.
            So, before the PCM signal sends to the PCM demodulator, we have to
            recover the signal to the original level for that we are using a
            comparator. The PCM signal is a series pulse wave signal, but for
            demodulation, we need a wave to be parallel.
            <br /><br />
            By using a serial to parallel converter the series pulse wave signal
            will be converted into a parallel digital signal. After that the
            signal will pass through the n-bits decoder, it should be a Digital
            to Analog converter. Decoder recovers the original quantization
            values of the digital signal. This quantization value also includes
            a lot of high-frequency harmonics with original audio signals. For
            avoiding unnecessary signals we utilize a low-pass filter at the
            final part.

            Quantization Process:
          </h3>
          <p>
            A continuous signal, such as voice, has a continuous range of
            amplitudes and therefore its samples have a continuous amplitude
            range. In other words, within the finite amplitude range of the
            signal, we find an infinite number of amplitude levels. It is not
            necessary in fact to transmit the exact amplitudes of the samples.
            Any human sense (the ear or the eye), as an ultimate receiver, can
            detect only finite intensity differences. This means the original
            continuous signal may be approximated by a

            signal constructed of discrete amplitudes selected on a minimum
            error basis from an available set. For example, amplitude
            quantization is defined as the process of transforming the sample
            amplitude m(nTs) of a message signal m(t) at time t = nTs into a
            discrete amplitude v(nTs) taken from finite set of possible
            amplitudes.

            Quantization Noise in PCM:
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is the type of quantization error, which usually occurs in analog
            to digital converter. For example, in music, the signals keep
            changing continuously, where regularity is not found in errors. Such
            errors create a wideband noise called Quantization Noise. <br />
            <br />
            Quantization approximates the sampled value to the nearest discrete
            value from the set of finite discrete levels. Quantizers are of two
            types.

            Companding in PCM Systems
          </h3>
          <p>
            The word Companding is a combination of Compressing and Expanding,
            which means that it does both. This non-linear technique is used in
            PCM which compresses the data at the transmitter and expands the
            same data at the receiver. The effects of noise and crosstalk are
            reduced by using this technique
          </p>

            Companding means it amplifies the low-level signals as well as
            attenuates the high level at the transmitter side. At the receiver
            side reverse operation is done. It attenuates the low-level signals
            and amplifies the high-level signals you get the original signal.

          <p>There are two types of Companding techniques. They are ‚Äì</p>
          <h3 class="text-[24px] font-semibold text-black">
            1. A-law Companding Technique
          </h3>
          <p class="pl-8">
            i. Uniform quantization is achieved at A = 1, where the
            characteristic curve is linear and no compression is done. <br />
            ii. A-law has a mid-rise at the origin. Hence, it contains a
            non-zero value. <br />
            iii. A-law Companding is used for PCM telephone systems. <br />
            F(x) = sgn(x){(A|x|)/(1+ln‚Å°(A))}, where |x| < (1/A) <br />
            = sgn(x) {(1 +ln‚Å°„Äñ(A|x|)„Äó)/(1+ln‚Å°(A))}, where (1/A) ‚â§ |x| ‚â§ 1,
            <br />
            Where A is the compression parameter. In Europe, A = 87.6, and
            sgn(x) is the sign function.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-[24px] font-semibold text-black">
            2. Œº-law Companding Technique
          </h3>
          <p class="pl-8">
            The Œº-law algorithm provides a slightly larger dynamic range than
            the A-law at the cost of worse proportional distortion for small
            signals. <br />
            i. Uniform quantization is achieved at ¬µ = 0, where the
            characteristic curve is linear and no compression is done. <br />
            ii. ¬µ-law has mid-tread at the origin. Hence, it contains a zero
            value. <br />
            iii. ¬µ-law companding is used for speech and music signals. <br />
            <br />
            For a given input x, the equation for ¬µ-law encoding is <br />
            F(x) = sgn(x) {ln‚Å°„Äñ(1+ ¬µ|x|)„Äó/(ln(1+ ¬µ))}, -1 ‚â§ x ‚â§1, <br />
            Where, ¬µ = 255 in the North America and Japanese standards. <br />

            Signal to Quantization Noise ratio in PCM:
          </h3>
          <p class="pl-8">
            The signal-to-quantization noise ratio is given as: <br />
            S/Nq = (Normalized signal power)/(Normalized noise power) <br />
            = (Normalized signal power) / (‚àÜ2/12) ‚Ä¶ (i) <br />
            <br />
            The number of quantization values is equal to: <br />
            q = 2v <br />
            Where v is the number of bits used to represent each level <br />
            On the other hand, the step size is represented as <br />
            ‚àÜ = (2 . Xmax) / 2v <br />
            <br />
            Substitute this value in equation (i), and we get <br />
            S/Nq = (Normalized signal power)/(„Äñ[(2 . X_max)/2^v ]„Äó^2 . 1/12)
            <br />
            Let the normalized signal power is equal to P then the
            signal-to-quantization noise will be given by <br />
            S/Nq = (3P * 2^2v)/(X_max^2 ) <br />
            <br />
            The above equation shows that the output signal-to-noise ratio of
            the quantizer increases exponentially with an increasing number of
            bits per sample, v. recognizing that an increase in v requires a
            proportionate increase in the channel (transmission) bandwidth BT,
            we thus see that the use of a binary code for the representation of
            a message signal (as in pulse code modulation) provides a more
            efficient method than either frequency modulation (FM) or pulse
            position modulation (PPM) for the trade-off of increased channel
            bandwidth for improved noise performance. In making this statement,
            we presume that the FM and PPM systems are limited by receiver
            noise, whereas the binary-coded modulation is limited by
            quantization error/noise. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-semibold">Example</span> <br />
            Consider the special case of a full-load sinusoidal modulating
            signal of amplitude Am, which utilizes all the representation levels
            provided. The average signal power is (assuming a load of 1 ohm)
            <br />
            P = (A_m^2)/2 <br />
            The total range of the quantizer input is 2Am, because the
            modulating signal swings between - Am and Am. We may therefore set
            Xmax = Am. <br />
            <br />Thus the output signal-to-noise ratio of a uniform quantizer,
            for a full-load test tone, is
            <br />
            (SNR)o = (A_m^2/2)/((1/3).„Äñ A„Äó_m^2.2^(-2v) ) = (3/2) . 22v <br />
            Expressing the signal-to-noise ratio in decibels, we get
            10log10(SNR)0 = 1.8 + 6v <br />
            <br />

            As the normalized quantizer error is ‚àÜ2/12. So, the quantization
            error or noise should be <br />
            œÉ_Q^2 = ‚àÜ2/12 = 1/3 . X_max^2 . 2^(-2v) [as ‚àÜ = (2X_max)/2^v ]
            <br />
            Or, œÉ_Q^2 = ‚àÜ2/12 = 1/3 . A_m^2 . 2^(-2v) <br />
