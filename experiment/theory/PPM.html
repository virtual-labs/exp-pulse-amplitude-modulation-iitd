            Pulse-position modulation (PPM)
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Pulse-position modulation (PPM) is a form of signal modulation in
            which M message bits are encoded by transmitting a single pulse in
            one of 2M possible required time shifts. This is repeated every T
            seconds, such that the transmitted bit rate is M/T bits per second.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pulse position modulation is one type of analog modulation which
            allows variation within the position of the pulses based on the
            sampled modulating signal’s amplitude is called PPM or Pulse
            Position Modulation. In this type of modulation, the amplitude &
            width of the pulses are kept stable & the position of the pulses
            only varied.
            <br />
            <br />
            The PPM technique allows computers to transmit data by simply
            measuring the time taken to reach each data packet to the computer.
            So is frequently used within optical communication where there is
            small multi-pathway interference. This modulation totally transmits
            digital signals & cannot be utilized by analog systems. It transmits
            simple data which is not efficient while transferring files.

            The noise corrupted PPM waveform is received by the PPM demodulator
            circuit. The pulse generator develops a pulsed waveform at its
            output of fixed duration and applies these pulses to the reset pin
            (R) of a SR flip-flop. A fixed period reference pulse is generated
            from the incoming PPM waveform and the SR flip-flop is set by the
            reference pulses. Due to the set and reset signals applied to the
            flip-flop, we get a PWM signal at its output. The PWM signal can be
            demodulated using the PWM demodulator.

            Effect of noise on pulse position modulation
          </h3>
          <p>
            Since in a PPM system the transmitted information is contained in
            the relative positions of the modulated pulses, the presence of
            additive noise affects the performance of such a system by
            falsifying the time at which the modulated pulses are judged to
            occur. Immunity to noise can be established by making the pulse
            build up too rapidly that the time interval during which noise can
            exert any perturbation is very short. Indeed, additive noise would
            have no effect on the pulse positions if the received pulses were
            perfectly rectangular, because the presence of noise introduces only
            vertical perturbations. However, the reception of perfectly
            rectangular pulses would require an infinite channel bandwidth, and
            the received pulses have a finite rise time, so the performance of
            the PPM receiver is affected by noise, which is to be expected.
            <br />
            <br />
            As in a continuous wave (CW) modulation system, the noise
            performance of a PPM system may be described in terms of the output
            signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Also, to find the noise improvement
            produced by PPM over baseband transmission of a message signal, we
            may use the figure of merit defined as the output signal-to-noise
            ratio of the PPM system divided by the channel signal-to-noise
            ratio. Assuming that the average power of the channel noise is small
            as compared to the peak pulse power, the figure of merit of the PPM
            system is proportional to the square of the transmission bandwidth
            of the (say, BT) normalized with respect to the message signal
            bandwidth (say, W). When, however, the input signal-to-noise ratio
            drops below a critical value, the system suffers a loss of the
            wanted message signal at the receiver output. That is a PPM system
            suffers from a threshold effect of its own.

          <h3 class="text-[24px] font-semibold text-black">Delta Modulation</h3>
          <p>
            DM is the simplest form of differential pulse-code modulation
            (DPCM). The encoder performs the function of differentiation; a
            quantizer precedes the differencing of adjacent quantized samples;
            the decoder is an accumulator, which if correctly initialized
            exactly recovers the quantized signal. In this technique, the
            difference between successive samples is encoded into n-bit data
            streams. In delta modulation, the transmitted data are reduced to a
            1-bit data stream. It uses the simplest possible quantizer i.e.
            two-level or one-bit quantizer.

            DPCM is much simpler if we just use the previous sample for the
            predictor. The predictor is just a delay. In delta modulation, the
            transmitted data are reduced to a 1-bit data stream. It uses the
            simplest possible quantizer i.e. two-level or one-bit quantizer.

            Here, the present sample value is compared with the previous sample
            value and this result whether the amplitude is increased or
            decreased is transmitted. If the difference is positive then the
            approximated signal is increased by one step i.e. ′∆′ and ‘1’ is
            transmitted. If the difference is negative then the approximated
            signal is reduced by ′∆′ and ‘0’ is transmitted as shown in the
            figure. Since the delta modulation transmits only one bit per
            sample. Therefore, the signalling rate and transmission bandwidth is
            quite small for delta modulation as compared to PCM and DPCM.

          </h3>
          <p>
            There are two kinds of quantization errors or noises that are

          </p>
          <p class="pl-8">
            Granular or Idle noise occurs when the step size is too large
            compared to a small variation in the input signal. This means that
            for very small variations in the input signal, the staircase signal
            is changed by a large amount (Δ) because of the large step size. The
            figure shows that when the input signal is almost flat, the
            staircase signal u(t) keeps on oscillating by ±Δ around the signal.
            The error between the input and approximated signal is called
            granular noise. The solution to this problem is to make the step
            size small.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md font-semibold">2. Slope Overload Distortion</p>
          <p class="pl-8">
            Slope overload distortion occurs due to the large dynamic range of
            the input signal. In the above figure, the rate of rise of input
            signal x(t) is so high that the staircase signal cannot approximate
            it, the step size delta becomes too small for staircase signal u(t)
            to follow the step segment of x(t). Hence, there is a large error
            between the staircase approximated signal and the original input
            signal x(t). This error or noise is known as slope overload
            distortion.

            The Delta Modulation method is generally used for the encoding of
            signals from analog to PCM. It is also applied for signal conversion
            in television systems. One of the most critical applications of this
            technique is that it is used for real-time Signal Processing
