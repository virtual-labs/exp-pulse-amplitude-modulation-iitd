      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Increasing bandwidth can help reduce ISI but increases the system's susceptibility to noise due to a broader noise spectrum.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Quantization error is not directly addressed by bandwidth.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Amplitude resolution is determined by quantizer levels, not bandwidth.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Improved noise immunity and higher BER are contradictory."

      "answers": {
        "a": "High-frequency harmonics result in greater switching losses",

        "c": "PWM requires higher sampling rates than PAM",
        "d": "Duty cycle variations distort the signal envelope"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! High-frequency switching leads to increased power loss in the form of heat due to parasitic capacitances and inductances.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Linear amplifiers are not typically used in PWM-based power circuits.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Sampling rates are not inherently higher for PWM.",

      "question": "3. In Pulse Position Modulation (PPM), how does timing jitter specifically impact the symbol detection process in a non-ideal receiver?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It randomly shifts the phase of the detected pulses",
        "b": "It causes inter-symbol interference due to overlapping symbols",
        "c": "It introduces uncertainty in pulse arrival times, increasing symbol error probability",
        "d": "It reduces the amplitude of received pulses, causing clipping"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. PPM is position-based, not phase-based.",
        "b": "Incorrect. PPM does not suffer ISI in the traditional sense due to non-overlapping symbols.",
        "c": "Correct! Jitter directly affects the timing of pulse arrival, which is central to detection in PPM.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Spectral nulls relate to pulse shape and windowing, not nonlinearity.",
        "b": "Correct! Nonlinearities introduce distortion that generates new unwanted frequency components.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Noise floor is not inherently raised by nonlinearity.",

        "a": "Correct! PWM allows transistors to operate in on/off modes, minimizing power dissipation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Resolution advantage depends on implementation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. PWM often introduces more EMI due to fast edges.",

      "question": "6. In high-speed PPM systems, what is a key reason for preferring higher-order modulation despite its susceptibility to timing jitter?",
      "answers": {
